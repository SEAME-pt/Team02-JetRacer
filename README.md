## About The Project

The **JetRacer Assembly** project is our team's first step in the Seam:Me Mobility course. This hands-on project allows us to dive into the world of electronics, robotics, and programming by assembling and testing a JetRacer — a small racing car powered by the **Jetson Nano Developer Kit**. Through this project, we enhanced our skills in software programming and practical problem-solving. We explored the construction of the car and plan to develop 3D parts for future enhancements. We learned about motors, car controlling with C language, and remote control.

In this project, we have two main components:

1. **Car Controller:** Developed in C, this component is responsible for controlling the motors, direction, speed, and other functionalities of the car.
2. **Xbox Controller:** Also developed in C, this component serves as the remote controller, allowing for the control of the car's movements and actions.
